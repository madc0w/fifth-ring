			<h1>The Fifth Ring</h1>
			<p>
				The shrieks of the Small Ones rang out over the land.
			</p>
			<p>
				"It is lost! Never again shall we know peace. O horror of horrors... We are forsaken!"
			</p>
			<p>
				In their misery and anguish, they called out to the Old Ones.
			</p>
			<p>
				"Help us! Seek the Fifth Ring, for without it, the Tower of the Five Rings will not be complete, and all is forever lost."
			</p>
			<p>
				The Old Ones rose from their thousand-year slumber to heed the call of the Small Ones.
			</p>
			<p>
				"We will not rest until the Fifth Ring is found, and the Tower is once again whole."
			</p>
			<p>
				For countless moons, the Old Ones searched the land's forgetten reaches while the Small Ones wailed and shook. Their quest took them to the highest nameless peaks
				of the eastern mountains, though wide fields, and over vast deserts. Hoards of treasure would be discovered, but alas, the Fifth Ring was not among these riches.
			</p>
			<p>
				At least, deep within a dark cavern, the Ring was found.
			</p>
			<p>
				"O joyous day!" cried out the Small Ones, as they completed the Tower of the Five Rings. The Small Ones and the Old Ones made merry and rejoiced for a whole season.
			</p>
			<p>
				And peace and joy were once again restored throughout the land.
